# Letshelp

This website is a university project.
As part of "dynamic web sites conception" course, we 3 are asked to create a website using html, php, and mysql. The topic is absolutely free.

We chose to create a mutual help website, where you can ask and also propose for help in differents areas.

The special feature of this website is that it can help you if you're late.
Indeed, you ask can submit for an excuse adapted to your current situation. Useful, isn't ? :)

Of course this is for a second degree use... If you want.
