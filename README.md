# Letshelp

This website is a university project.
As part of "dynamic web sites conception" course, students were asked to create a dynamic website using html, php, and mysql. The topic was absolutely free.

We chose to create a mutual help website, where anyone can ask and offer for help of different matters.

The special feature of this website is the excuse generator. If you are late, you can ask submit for an excuse adapted to your current situation. Useful, isn't ? :) Aimed at a second degree use... Or not.
