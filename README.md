# Letshelp

## Context
This website is my bachelor's degree university project, part of "dynamic web sites conception" course.
Students were asked to create a free-of-choice dynamic website using html, php, and mysql.

## Objective

This website is a mutual help platform. Any registered user can submit an ad, informing the location, the category, and a short description of the submission. Submissions can be anything: Saling items, offering help, and the other way around (Asking for help, seeking for an item).

Users have the ability to edit, and delete their ad. They also have the history of their activity, in private access. 

Anyone can directly contact the author of an ad via a form, available on the ad page. The author will be reached by email, without is address to be ever made public. 

Ads integrate a counter of views and of messages sent to the author of the ad. 

An administrative interface is available, where admins can view the list of users and their activity. Admins can also moderate ads of any user. 

The special feature of this website is the _Excuse generator_. If you being are late, you can query the Database for an excuse adapted to your situation. This database of excuse is collaborative, i.e. any registered user can submit one, indicating in which kind of situation it can be used, and for what length of delay.
